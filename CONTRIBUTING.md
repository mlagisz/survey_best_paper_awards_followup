# CONTRIBUTION GUIDE    

**Our mission statement:** *Making “best paper” awards more transparent, inclusive, and aligned with Open Science values across disciplines.* 🌟  


## 💛  Contributing - general

 1. You must fill in the Expression Of Interest (EOI) form at: https://forms.gle/DVQAYqQSYjoM3TyQ8, so we can have your name and contact details (demographic questions are optional, but would be helpful).   
 2. We welcome researchers with all backgrounds and experience level to contribute to this project.   
 3. You don't need any special research skills - just attention to detail, Internet access, and some spare time available.
 4. All contributions to this project are voluntary. We will not provide financial renumaration for any contributions (we have no dedicated funding).   
 5. To enable broad global participation, we will mostly work asynchroniously online until we complete all stages of the project.
 6. We will email specific contributing instructions to the project participants, for the project tasks they sign up to.   
 7. If you would like to comment on this project or provide suggestions to improve this project, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or reach directly to us via a dedicated Slack channel (invites will be sent to project participants who filled in the EOI form: https://forms.gle/J3WPWMTAyWJy3k1v9) or email (losialagisz@gmail.com). We will provide clarifications and answer questions via email and dedicated Slack channel, as needed (so get in touch when you need help or explanations). Especially, please let us know when you are stuck or you don't have time to finish a given task, so we can find a replacement/help and keep moving forward.   
 8. We will periodically email you or post updates on project progress on Slack and GitHub. 
 9. You can withdraw from the project at any time. 
 10. We expect all project contributors to familiarise themselves and follow our [CODE OF CONDUCT](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 💝  Acknowledgement of contributions   
All project participants who contributed any amount of work, and provided their details, 
will be acknowledged as project contributors on the project page, report, presentations, and manuscript. 
We will mainly use a CRediT-like statement format, but we will also keep a more detailed record
of individual contributions to specific tasks within the stages of the project. 
This record will be also made publicly available as part of the open project materials (as a publicly available data set). 
You can request to have your details removed or obscured at any time.    

## 📄 Co-authorship  
Project participants with substantial and high-quality contributions (as defined below and as assessed by the team members) will become co-authors of the manuscript. 
The potential co-authors will contribute to any or all of these: data extraction, checking, analyses and/or report drafting.    

Substantial contributions could be achieved by performing **both** tasks listed below:
- extracting award description data for the assigned set of awards   
- cross-checking extracting award description data for the assigned set of awards  

IMPORTANT: Authorship is also conditional on reading and approving the final manuscript draft before submission
**and** providing all personal information (e.g., name, affiliation, email) needed for the submission.     

Additional contribution opportunities will be available via data cleaning, analyses, visualisations and writing,
as needed, and at the discretion of the project leads.   

Manuscript authorship positions:    
- In the manuscript, first and last authorship positions will be reserved to the project leads (they could be co-first and co-last positions).  
- Subsequent authorship positions will be determined by the total amount and quality of contributions, as in the project records.  
- For equal contributions the order of mid-authorship will be alphabetic.  
- All authors must read and approve the final manuscript draft before submission.  
- The manuscript will contain a CRediT-like statement detailing the roles of individual authors and contributors.   


## 📍 Final notes   
Project leads reserve the right to interpret and change the contribution rules at any time, if such need arises. 
In case of any disputes decisions of project leads will be final.
